                <p> always enjoy eating at a restaurant, probably because it means I do not have to cook! My mother always told me that it is much more healthier for me to have a meal at home. I actually like cooking, but sometimes it wastes a lot of time, because of my busy study. When the wonderful time comes to go , my first favorite place is the Teriyaki Restaurant. It is undeniable that Teriyaki is the best restaurant. I am so happy to introduce it. It is located in the campus near my class, I visit this restaurant 5 to 6 times per week. The first time when I visited, I instantly felt the great welcome and smelled the delicious food. It has beautiful decor and looks very fashionable.</p>
                
                <h3>Chicken Dishes</h3>
                <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry/meat in the world, and was one of the first domesticated animals. Chicken is a major worldwide source of meat and eggs for human consumption. It is prepared as food in a wide variety of ways, varying by region and culture. The prevalence of chickens is due to almost the entire chicken being edible, and the ease of raising them.</p>

                <h3>Beef Dishes</h3>
                <p>beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef is firm, velvety, fine-grained, lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled.</p>

                <h3>Sushi Dishes</h3>
                <p>Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called sumeshi (酢飯). The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori (海苔).</p>
